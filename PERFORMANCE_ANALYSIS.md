# Production Performance Analysis - Notes Copilot

## Current Performance Profile (With Optimizations)

### Typical Query Timeline: **10-15 seconds**

| Phase | Time | Percentage | Optimization Potential |
|-------|------|------------|----------------------|
| 1. Query embedding (Gemini API) | 2.5-3.5s | 25% | ⚠️ High - can eliminate with caching |
| 2. Vector search (PostgreSQL) | 0.15-0.4s | 3% | ✅ Already optimized |
| 3. MMR re-ranking (15 embeddings) | 4-6s | 45% | ⚠️ Critical bottleneck |
| 4. Answer generation (Gemini) | 3-5s | 30% | ⚠️ Can stream, but API-bound |
| **TOTAL** | **10-15s** | 100% | |

---

## The Critical Issue: MMR Re-ranking

**Problem:** We're embedding 10-15 text chunks EVERY query for diversity ranking

**Why it's slow:**
- Each embedding API call: ~3-4 seconds
- Even with 10 concurrent workers: limited by slowest call
- **This is the single biggest bottleneck** (45% of query time)

**Why we're doing it:**
- Ensures diverse, non-redundant results
- Better answer quality (not just top-k most similar)

---

## Comparison: What Are Users Expecting?

### Consumer Products
- **ChatGPT**: 2-5 seconds (streaming feels instant)
- **Perplexity AI**: 3-8 seconds (with citations)
- **Claude**: 1-4 seconds (streaming)
- **Gemini**: 2-5 seconds (streaming)

### Document Q&A Products
- **Notion AI**: 3-7 seconds
- **Glean**: 2-6 seconds (enterprise, massive index)
- **Mendable**: 4-10 seconds (technical docs)
- **ChatPDF**: 5-12 seconds (similar to us!)

### User Perception Research
- **< 1 second**: Feels instant
- **1-3 seconds**: Acceptable, no explanation needed
- **3-10 seconds**: Need progress indicator ("Searching 12 documents...")
- **> 10 seconds**: Needs progress updates or feels broken

---

## Production Readiness Assessment

### ✅ What's Good
1. **Consistent performance**: 10-15s is predictable
2. **Similar to competitors**: ChatPDF is in same range
3. **Quality is high**: MMR ensures good results
4. **Cold start eliminated**: First query = subsequent queries
5. **Scales horizontally**: Can add more backend instances

### ⚠️ What's Concerning
1. **No streaming**: User sees nothing for 10-15 seconds
2. **No progress feedback**: Feels frozen
3. **MMR bottleneck**: 45% of time on one operation
4. **No caching**: Same question = same 10-15s wait

### 🚨 What's a Dealbreaker
- **Mobile users will bounce**: 10-15s on mobile = instant close
- **Power users will notice**: Asking 10 questions = 2+ minutes waiting
- **Can't compete with ChatGPT**: 10-15s vs 2-5s is huge perceptual difference

---

## Real-World Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Student Studying (50+ questions/session)
- **Current**: 50 × 12s = **10 minutes of waiting** 😱
- **With caching (80% hit)**: 10 × 12s + 40 × 0.5s = **2.5 minutes** 😐
- **With all optimizations**: 50 × 3s = **2.5 minutes** 😊

### Scenario 2: Researcher Skimming
- Asks 5-10 exploratory questions quickly
- **Current**: 10 × 12s = **2 minutes** 😐
- Acceptable if progress shown, streaming would help

### Scenario 3: Professional Quick Lookup
- Needs one-off answer during meeting
- **Current**: 12 seconds 😐
- Competitor (ChatGPT with browsing): 5 seconds 😊

## The Brutal Truth

### Your product is **3-5x slower than ChatGPT** for user-perceived speed.

**Why?**
1. ChatGPT uses **streaming** - shows first token in ~500ms
2. ChatGPT has **massive caching** infrastructure
3. ChatGPT **doesn't re-embed** on every query
4. ChatGPT inference is **highly optimized** (proprietary infra)

### But you have an advantage:
- **Private documents**: ChatGPT can't search user's notes
- **Citations**: You show exact sources
- **Visual understanding**: You extract images from PDFs
- **Accuracy**: Your answers are grounded in actual documents

---

## Recommendations: Three Paths Forward

### Path 1: Ship As-Is (Minimal Risk, Minimal Reward)
**Timeline:** Ready now
**Performance:** 10-15s per query
**User Experience:** Acceptable for niche users (students, researchers)

**Add these quick wins:**
1. ✅ Progress indicator: "Searching 12 documents..." → "Analyzing results..." → "Generating answer..."
2. ✅ Skeleton loader with animations
3. ✅ Show partial results: Display citations BEFORE answer completes
4. ✅ Set expectations: "This usually takes 10-15 seconds"

**Good for:** MVP, getting user feedback, validating product-market fit
**Risk:** High bounce rate, users compare to ChatGPT and leave

---

### Path 2: Quick Optimizations (1-2 weeks, High Impact)
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks of work
**Performance:** 3-7s per query
**User Experience:** Competitive with document Q&A products

**Implement:**
1. 🎯 **Redis query caching** (80% hit rate)
   - Cache: (user_id, question_hash) → (answer, citations)
   - TTL: 1 hour
   - Impact: Cached queries: 10-15s → **0.5s** ⚡

2. 🎯 **Pre-compute chunk embeddings** (eliminate MMR bottleneck)
   - Store embeddings during upload, not during query
   - Impact: Removes 4-6s from every query
   - New timing: 10-15s → **5-9s**

3. 🎯 **Streaming response** (perceived instant)
   - Stream Gemini output token-by-token
   - User sees first token in ~3s instead of waiting 12s
   - Impact: Feels **3x faster** even though total time similar

4. 🎯 **Async mode** (for mobile)
   - Accept query, return job ID immediately
   - Poll for results (or WebSocket)
   - User can continue browsing while waiting

**Combined impact:** 10-15s → **3-7s** (or instant with cache hit)
**Good for:** Production launch, competing with ChatPDF/Mendable
**Risk:** Engineering complexity, Redis dependency

---

### Path 3: Major Rewrite (1-2 months, Industry-Leading)
**Timeline:** 1-2 months
**Performance:** 1-3s per query
**User Experience:** Competitive with ChatGPT

**Implement:**
1. 🚀 **Local embedding model** (sentence-transformers)
   - Replace Gemini embeddings with local model
   - Impact: 3s API call → **0.1s** local inference
   - Trade-off: Slightly lower quality

2. 🚀 **Approximate search** (skip MMR)
   - Use top-k directly from pgvector
   - Impact: Eliminates 4-6s MMR step entirely
   - Trade-off: Slightly more redundant results

3. 🚀 **Precomputed answers** (aggressive caching)
   - Generate common Q&A pairs at upload time
   - "What is this document about?" pre-answered
   - Impact: Instant for common queries

4. 🚀 **Speculative execution**
   - Start generating answer while search is still running
   - Abort and restart if search results change
   - Impact: Saves 2-3s overlap time

5. 🚀 **Edge deployment**
   - Deploy to Cloudflare Workers / Vercel Edge
   - Local embeddings run on edge
   - Impact: Reduces latency 50-200ms globally

**Combined impact:** 10-15s → **1-3s**
**Good for:** Funded startup, competing with ChatGPT
**Risk:** High complexity, major architecture changes, potential quality trade-offs

## Recommended Launch Strategy

### Phase 1: Launch Now with UX Improvements (Week 1)
- Add progress indicators
- Add streaming (if possible with Gemini API)
- Add "expected time" messaging
- **Target:** 10-15s feels acceptable with good UX

### Phase 2: Cache Everything (Week 2-3)
- Implement Redis caching
- Pre-compute chunk embeddings
- **Target:** 5-9s typical, 0.5s cached

### Phase 3: Architecture Optimization (Month 2-3)
- Evaluate local embeddings
- Consider approximate search
- Add edge deployment
- **Target:** 1-3s industry-leading

---

## Bottom Line

### Can you ship this now?
**Yes**, but with caveats:

**✅ Ship if:**
- You're targeting patient users (students, researchers)
- You have excellent UX (progress, streaming)
- You're OK with 20-40% bounce rate
- You plan to optimize within 1-2 months

**🚫 Don't ship if:**
- You need viral growth (users will compare to ChatGPT)
- You're targeting mobile users (10-15s is death)
- You need enterprise deals (they'll expect <5s)
- You can't commit to optimization roadmap

### My recommendation:
**Implement Path 2 (Quick Optimizations) BEFORE launch**

Spend 1-2 weeks to get to 3-7s with caching. This crosses the threshold from "acceptable" to "good" and gives you a fighting chance against competitors.

The difference between 12s and 4s is the difference between users tolerating your product and users loving your product.
