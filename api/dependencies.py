# api/dependencies.py - DEPRECATED
# Path: api/dependencies.py
# This file is no longer used. The main embedding system is in core/embeddings.py
# and search functionality uses PostgreSQL vector search in core/search_pg.py
#
# This file was creating import conflicts and is being phased out.
# If you need embedding functionality, use core/embeddings.py instead.
#
# TODO: Remove this file once confirmed no longer needed.
